          The new HalfStack CfP process is a significant change from traditional
          CfP after having time to reflect on what we like and dislike about
          CfPs during COVID.

          The new approach is open-ended, with no formal deadlines or
          guidelines. You simply create a Living Spec document, add the details
          you feel are relevant (please limit to two session ideas), share your
          CfP document with hello at halfstackconf dot com (in email address
          form, share as admin), and we&apos;ll review and give you feedback. If
          we have space and feel the session is relevant, we&apos;ll invite you
          to speak. All preliminary communication will happen within the Living
          Spec document.

          In general, excellent HalfStack sessions are creative, humo(u)rous and
          inspiring, focus more on what we can create with the web platform than
          the specific framework. They&apos;re generally not full scale
          tutorials, but more &quot;here&apos;s how I created something,
          here&apos;s the fun demo&quot;.

          For years HalfStack has showcased many of our side projects. Living
          Spec started as HalfStack founder Dylan Schiemann&apos;s side project
          before becoming his full time hustle!

          Living Spec is typically used for your team to create your next
          product spec! Amazing conference sessions are their own mini-products,
          so now you have the freedom to create your own session spec, rather
          than being confined to whatever form fields we think are interesting.
          Living Spec is in beta so please be patient if you run into any
          issues.
