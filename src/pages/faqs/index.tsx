      Never. We will send you a few emails with information about the event, and
      one email after the event with follow-up information. Beyond that, if you
      want to hear from us again, you may opt-in to our{" "}

    "What is your position on COVID-19?",
    <>
      Due to COVID-19, all in-person indoor HalfStack events originally
      scheduled from March 2020 were postponed indefinitely and we&apos;re in
      the process of cautiously reopening.
      <br />
      <br />
      COVID-19 refund policy: Full refunds are available up to 7 days prior to a
      scheduled in-person event. If you wake up ill, stay home and we&apos;ll
      credit you with a ticket for a future event.
