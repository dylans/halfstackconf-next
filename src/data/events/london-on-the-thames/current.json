Jo's lil mum relies on lip reading and clear sounds to understand what people are saying. But Jo, of course, wants her to stay safe. So the thought occurred. Can we make a live caption display fit into a mask so that she can read what Joe is saying",

        "In the age of data overload, it is difficult to build applications that make it easier for users to identify key trends and insights. However, with a lack of design experience or the need to fulfil the demand to deliver value quickly, many teams use data grids to present all data for users to consume. While building financial systems and dashboards, Carly learned that grids are not always the right tool for the job. And Carly has built a lot of them! We tend to over-leverage grids instead of discovering the true objective of our users and suggesting the right control for the job. This leads to information overload for users as they try to figure out what data is truly relevant and useful",
        "",
        "In this session, Carly will make the case for collaborating with users to find the right control to use. Carly will also share a series of data grid behaviour antipatterns that suggest it is not the right control for you and suggest potential charts or controls to improve the user experience along with examples written for React using libraries such as Recharts, Elastic Charts, Highcharts, Nivo and AG Grid."
