        "Live coding is a new direction in electronic music and video. Live coders expose and rewire the innards of software while it generates improvised music and/or visuals. All code manipulation is projected for all to see. Live coding works across musical genres, and has been seen in concert halls, late-night jazz bars, as well as algoraves.",
        "Sonic Pi is a live coding environment built specifically for creating music. It's based in the Ruby programming language and it's primary aim is to provide a fun and approachable way to learn how to code while stimulating creativity. Though Sonic Pi is an educational tool, it is still a powerful tool and has been used by professional live coders around the globe",
        "In their performances, Earth to Abigail likes to take advantage of Sonic Pi's easily readable language to emphasize the poetic capabilities that code can provide but that is often overlooked. In this kind of creative context, code has not only a utilitarian purpose but also a poetic one, complementing the music it creates."

In this session, we will explore the power of hardware APIs, such as WebHID, WebUSB and WebSerial, and connect the browser to essential components such as a cash drawer, customer display, receipt printer and barcode scanner. We'll also touch on other new Project Fugu APIs like Idle Detection, Multi-screen Window Placement and Shape Detection. And finally, we will show how this works in practice with a live demonstration of all the components."
