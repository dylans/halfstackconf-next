        "Digital twin is a trending buzzword at large industrial companies. But what is it? Through a concrete, small-scale application, you will learn how you can — but probably shouldn’t — build digital twins around your home. We will look at the required steps and tools you can use to build your own, taking the example of a door and how its digital twin can enable predictive maintenance operations. Throughout the talk, we will reflect on the DevOps challenges created by the physical components of a system."
