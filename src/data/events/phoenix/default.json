      "An authentic, high value experience for attendees and sponsors focused on the creative side of JavaScript and web development.",
      "The priority for our events is the attendee experience, with great food, drinks, talks, swag, and community. We’ve selected the amazing Majestic Theater and we’re intentionally adding more breaks and downtime into the schedule to create a more relaxed environment with extra time for us to interact and reconnect.",
      "Now on two screens! The primary screen will be the live presenter, while the second screen will be a place where you can still watch the session livestream, but feel free to talk with your peers or just get away from the crowd if needed.",
      "HalfStack carefully curates talks that inspire and inform the audience in a highly interactive and entertaining manner. An intimate feeling where each attendee has time to meet one another; maximum capacity for HalfStack Phoenix is 200 attendees.",
      "Organizations are invited to help our event through sponsorship. Choose from our sponsor levels or propose your own."
