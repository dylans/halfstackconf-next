        "Programming is a skill set with many obvious benefits for pursuing the discipline in earnest. For a 12-year-old, most of these reasons are not applicable or interesting, so a different incentive system is required. Because we do not have the luxury of a fully formed prefrontal cortex to paint a vivid picture of the future glory that awaits us when we finally pull into the Delayed Gratification Station™, we must focus on the experience itself. How do we make programming a fulfilling and exciting activity purely on the merits of it being a fulfilling and exciting activity? This can be a bit circular, but such are the machinations of preteens.",

        "Since we are now deviating from sound and sensible grow-up logic, what if we could use programming as a delivery mechanism to hide the unpleasant and bitter taste of other educational responsibilities? What if programming could be so fun that we could sneak in math, science, language arts, etc. lessons, and NO ONE WOULD EVEN NOTICE!?",

        "Lukas (grown-up) and Ian (hatchling) Ruebbelke will share a framework that they have worked out (under duress at times) to make programming more fun and education less visible in their academic journey."

        "In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, individuals often find themselves entangled in the demanding web of responsibilities and burnout, particularly in the realm of accessibility. This abstract explores the profound experience of leaving the fast-paced world of technology, focusing on the challenges and burnout associated with the pursuit of making digital spaces inclusive for all. As professionals navigate the intricate web of accessibility, they encounter not only technical challenges but also grapple with the toll it takes on their well-being. The discussion delves into personal narratives of burnout, shedding light on the importance of recognizing the signs, embracing change, and ultimately embarking on a journey of retirement from the tech world.",

        "Retirement, in this context, symbolizes not just the end of a career but a deliberate choice to reclaim one's life and well-being. The transition from the tech industry to retirement is examined through the lens of personal growth, self-discovery, and the pursuit of a more balanced and fulfilling life. By intertwining the narratives of leaving tech and navigating burnout in the realm of accessibility, this abstract aims to provoke thoughtful reflections on the intersections of professional identity, well-being, and the pursuit of a more meaningful and sustainable future beyond the confines of a demanding career."
