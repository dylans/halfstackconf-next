        "This developer disconnected from the modern world and found a completely new community on his doorstep. One comprised entirely of birds. After spending 12 months feeding, recording, and identifying them, he now has the perfect dataset to get geeky and have some fun.",

        "Bird song is a great example of the algorithmic properties of nature. Web Midi is the perfect way to express the algorithmic beauty of music in a digital first world. But what happens when you mix the two together?",

        "In his talk, Tony Edwards from Bluefruit Software, aims to find out. Using the bird song recordings captured during lockdown series one & two as a starting point (along with his trusty midi controller), Tony will walk the HalfStack community through the creation of a few interactive demos.",

        "Will they work? Probably. Will there be cat gifs? Definitely."

My lil mum relies on lip reading and clear sounds to understand what people are saying. But I, of course, want her to stay safe. So the thought occurred. Can I make a live caption display fit into a mask so that she can read what I'm saying?",

        "I've worked with dozens of schools and code clubs to develop child-friendly STEM resources and activities that help children learn about AI through making. In developing and delivering these hands-on sessions, I've supported children to create many different machine learning-powered projects. In all of this, I've been fascinated to see what they've learned from these experiences.",

        "In this session, I want to share what I've seen. I will demonstrate AI/ML projects made by children - but more importantly, I want to tell you some stories about how it went and the lessons they learned from making them.",

        "I think the insights these children gained provide a useful introduction for any developer looking to get started with AI/ML, so if you're new to the field I hope you'll get a useful introduction to how you can get started.",

        "If you already know your way around a machine learning model, I hope you'll find some of the experiences of the next generation interesting!"
