A lot of the things we are being paid for now can be done by machines. The question is if that should come as a surprise, or if this is an opportunity to scrutinise if what we do is actually not necessary? AI is a tool and it is here to stay. It is now up to us to make it work for us and teach the next generation of creators what's good and not what's *good enough*."
