        "Testing your digital products with real people is the only real way to see if what you've built actually works. The problem is, many of us just don't have the time or budget to run a full-scale usability test. Still, it's always better to do some testing rather than none. We'll cover all the basics for running your own short, successful usability tests on a shoestring budget, using just a few basic resources."

        "Digital twin is a trending buzzword at large industrial companies. But what is it? Through a concrete, small-scale application, you will learn how you can — but probably shouldn’t — build digital twins around your home. We will look at the required steps and tools you can use to build your own, taking the example of a door and how its digital twin can enable predictive maintenance operations. Throughout the talk, we will reflect on the DevOps challenges created by the physical components of a system."

        "When we view source our modern web applications, the code looks nothing like what we originally wrote. At a minimum, it’s gone through linting, transpilation, obfuscation, minification, and bundling. And in order to build our beautifully designed apps with sophisticated interactions, we leverage the latest features in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript available in our modern evergreen browsers.",
        "However, when web development was in its infancy two decades ago, things were drastically different. Sites had hit counters, used frames for navigation, and were updated manually via FTP. We used the blink tag and scrolling marquees! Let’s take a walk down memory lane (or have a history lesson) and have some laughs cringing at how sites looked, how they were built, and the rudimentary tooling we had to develop them."

        "Windows High Contrast Mode is a feature that is designed to make it easier for users with visual impairments to see and use their computer. However, this feature can cause some unexpected changes to the way that UI elements are displayed on the web, which can be confusing for developers.",
        "In this session, we will explore the technical details of how High Contrast Mode works, and we will discuss some common challenges and solutions for ensuring that web page elements are correctly displayed when this mode is enabled. By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how High Contrast Mode affects web development, and you will have some practical tools for addressing these challenges in your own work."

        "Did you know that Shakespeare wrote almost no direction into his plays? No fight direction. No staging. No notes to the songs. Of the 1700 words he created, there was no official dictionary. That’s right, the author of some of the greatest literary works in history - filled with situational complexity, fight sequences, and music - includes NO documentation! His words told the rest of the story. The text - the code - filled in the gaps. What can we learn from his texts? What can we apply to our modern day development efforts?"
