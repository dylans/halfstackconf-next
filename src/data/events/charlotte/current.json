        "Testing your digital products with real people is the only real way to see if what you've built actually works. The problem is, many of us just don't have the time or budget to run a full-scale usability test. Still, it's always better to do some testing rather than none. We'll cover all the basics for running your own short, successful usability tests on a shoestring budget, using just a few basic resources."

        "When we view source our modern web applications, the code looks nothing like what we originally wrote. At a minimum, it’s gone through linting, transpilation, obfuscation, minification, and bundling. And in order to build our beautifully designed apps with sophisticated interactions, we leverage the latest features in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript available in our modern evergreen browsers.",
        "However, when web development was in its infancy two decades ago, things were drastically different. Sites had hit counters, used frames for navigation, and were updated manually via FTP. We used the blink tag and scrolling marquees! Let’s take a walk down memory lane (or have a history lesson) and have some laughs cringing at how sites looked, how they were built, and the rudimentary tooling we had to develop them."

By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how High Contrast Mode affects web development, and you will have some practical tools for addressing these challenges in your own work."

        "Did you know that Shakespeare wrote almost no direction into his plays? No fight direction. No staging. No notes to the songs. Of the 1700 words he created, there was no official dictionary. That’s right, the author of some of the greatest literary works in history - filled with situational complexity, fight sequences, and music - includes NO documentation! His words told the rest of the story. The text - the code - filled in the gaps. What can we learn from his texts? What can we apply to our modern day development efforts?"

        "As a developer, it's natural to want your code to be as efficient as possible. But what defines efficiency? The answer varies depending on who you ask. For those bootstrapping a new web app, minimizing friction on the path to your launch is often the primary goal. Achieving this requires a web stack that maximizes your developer experience. We’ll explore the real world journey of balancing developer productivity with the challenges involved when building a modern web app."

WebRTC provides a foundation to make this possible, but WHIP and WHEP are new standards in progress to improved web based streaming and reduce latency. We'll look at some of the adventures and misadventures in making web-based streaming a reality."
