Thankfully, diving into 3D is more straightforward than ever.",

Features like chatting, text sync and cursor tracking allow users to stay within your app without moving to 3rd party solutions.",

We will cover popular use cases for collaborative features and the challenges that it poses for developers. There are a lot of things to consider when integrating collaboration such as conflict resolution, scalability, latency, etc. Using a library like Yjs can make your lives easier because most of the challenges are solved on the lib level, meaning that the developer only needs to worry about integration.",

So if you are the kind of an engineer who wants to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to web development, learn how Intersection Observer, Background Sync API, Screen Wake Lock API (and many more) can help you create better web applications that will keep users engaged and coming back for more!"
