Circles are one of the most straightforward geometric shapes, containing a certain pleasing symmetry and simplicity adored by both artists and the natural world alike. They are also an incredibly useful programming tool, in everything from function derivation and sound reproduction, to places as unexpected as algorithmic drawing and compression routines. In this session we will explore some of the lesser known applications of the humble circle, and see just how deep the rabbit hole goes."

        "Modern development often suffers from two fundamental misalignments: Frontend and Backend teams are racing toward the same feature, but from opposite directions, and almost always at different speeds. And boilerplate duplication efforts across multiple projects when syncing data between the Frontend and Backend.",
        "This session explores how we can eliminate that friction by treating the API contract as the source of truth and using it to generate the frontend client SDK automatically that can be shared across your development ecosystem (Web, Mobile, Backoffice, clients, etc). We are talking about real client code: fully-typed, runtime-validated, error-handling-capable, built instantly from a single file."
